**Deluge** is a load testing tool for web applications, web APIs, IoT, or any TCP based application.

## CLI

```sh
# Starts an orchestrator listening on the given port
$ deluge start orchestrator -port=9090

# Starts a worker listening on the given port as a slave of the given orchestrator
$ deluge start worker -port=8080 -orchestrator=187.32.87.353:9090

# Starts a worker listening on the given port without orchestrator
$ deluge start worker -port=8080

# Runs the deluge on the given worker/orchestrator. Uses REST API behind the scene.
$ deluge run <filename containing deluge and scenario(s)> -on-addr=187.32.87.353:9090

# Silently starts a worker, runs deluge, write report and shutdown worker. Uses REST API behind the scene.
$ deluge run <filename containing deluge and scenario(s)>
```

## REST API

### /jobs GET-POST-DELETE

POST request body example *(text/plain)*:

```js
// The request body contains the script (written in deluge-DSL) to run
deluge("Some name", "10s", {
    "sc1": {
        "concurrent": 100,
        "delay": "2s"
    }
});

scenario("sc1", "Some scenario", function () {

    http("Some request", {
        "url": "http://localhost:8080/hello/toto"
    });

});
```

POST/GET response body example of an **unfinished** job *(application/json)*:

```json
{
    "job_id": 876276,
    "status": "running",
    "report": null
}
```

POST/GET response body example of a **finished** job *(application/json)*:

```json
{
    "job_id": 876276,
    "status": "done",
    "report": {
        "Name": "My Deluge",
        "Duration": "10s",
        "ConcurrentUsersCount": 0,
        "Stats": {
            "Global": {  },
            "...": "..."
        }
    }
}
```

## Roadmap

- [x] core of the test runner, able to simulate concurrent users
- [x] flexible yet simple DSL to write test scenarios
- [x] recording, using HDRHistograms
- [ ] reporting, on a simple HTML page using JSON to export recorded data
- [ ] REST API (to run tests, get reports, etc.)
- [ ] CLI
- [ ] 'clustering' or 'server mode' to distribute concurrent users of a scenario across multiple Deluge instances (possibly cross-datacenter)
- [ ] ready to work Docker image


## DSL

The DSL consists of a simple but efficient language inspired from Javascript's syntax with native support of emiting requests on different protocols.

Supported protocols (out of the box) are:
- [ ] HTTP
- [ ] TCP
- [ ] MQTT
- [ ] gRPC

Everything has been made so it is extremely easy to perform requests as show in this example:

```js
let req = {
  "URL": "..."
};

let res = http(req);
// or
let res = tcp(req);
// or
let res = mqtt(req);
// or
let res = grpc(req);

if (res["status"] != 200) {
  fail();
}

assert(res["status"] == 200);

// launch async
async whatever();
async function(){
  // ...
}()
wait

async "group1" whatever();
async "group1" whatever();
wait "group1"
```
